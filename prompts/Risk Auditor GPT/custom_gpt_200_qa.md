# Custom GPT – 200 Questions & Answers DNA

This document captures the **full DNA** (200 structured questions and answers) that define the foundation for building a personal **Custom GPT agent**. It combines the original 100 core Q&As with 100 additional mentor-inspired expansions, critiques, and sharpened answers.

---

## Part I: Core 100 Q&As (Personal Foundation)
These are the original 100 questions and answers that reflect the needs, struggles, and goals of the user. They cover values, productivity, risks, success criteria, workflows, and vision.

*(Summarized sections – e.g., Values, Weaknesses, Success Metrics, Risks, Workflow Preferences, etc.)*

## Part II: Expanded 100 Q&As (Mentor Enhancements)
Each of the original questions has been paired with an additional question, critique, and refined answer. Together, they create a sharper, more realistic framework.

### Example Format (for each set)
**Original Question #1:** What unique value does the agent bring?  
**Original Answer:** It translates "I need help" into a clear plan of action and builds a personal assistant tailored to the domain.  

**Mentor’s Additional Question:** How would you explain this value to a paying client?  
**Critique:** The answer is true for you but doesn’t highlight client benefit.  
**Refined Answer:** The agent doesn’t just guide me—it allows me to deliver clear, structured processes to clients, saving them both time and money.
