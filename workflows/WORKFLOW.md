# Workflow – Initial Publication with 7 Agents

A flow management system (workflow) between the agents.  
Goal: publish a first post + an Asset Pack within one week.  
Principle: in each stage we work with **one agent only**, using a fixed Brief.  
We move forward only when the **Exit Criteria** are fully met.

## Stage 1 – Pitch
**Agent:** Idea-GPT  
**Task:** Draft an Elevator Pitch (Hebrew + English, up to 5 sentences).  
**Exit Criteria:** 2 pitch versions you are fully satisfied with (10/10).  
**Handoff:** Send to Closer-GPT.

### Agent Brief – Example
**Background**  
We built a system of 7 AI agents working together.  
Each agent has a CHANGELOG, private documentation, and a clear role.

**Agent’s Role**  
Idea-GPT: distill the core idea into short, clear sentences.

**Current Stage**  
Stage 1 – Elevator Pitch drafting.

**Precise Task**  
Provide **two final pitch versions** (Hebrew + English), sharp and clear, max 5 sentences each.

**Exit Criteria**  
We have two pitch versions I’m fully satisfied with.

## Stage 2 – Posts
**Agent:** Closer-GPT  
**Task:** Draft 3 short posts (LinkedIn / Facebook / Forum) based on the Pitch.  
**Exit Criteria:** 3 post drafts ready.

## Stage 3 – Message Review

**Task:** Review risks, language issues, and credibility. Select 1 approved version per channel.  
**Exit Criteria:** Approved drafts + risk notes (max 10 bullets).  
**Handoff:** Return to Idea-GPT + Catalyst-GPT.

## Stage 4 – Asset Pack
**Agents:** Idea-GPT + Catalyst-GPT  
**Task:**  
- Idea-GPT → write copy for a one-page PDF (introducing the 7 agents).

**Exit Criteria:** PDF draft ready + UX task list.  
**Handoff:** Send to Sheet-GPT.

## Stage 5 – Documentation
**Agent:** Sheet-GPT  
**Task:** Update CHANGELOG, back up Pitch/Posts/Assets into GitHub.  
**Exit Criteria:** Repository updated with README + saved outputs.
