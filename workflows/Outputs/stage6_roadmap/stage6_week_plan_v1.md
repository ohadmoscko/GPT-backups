|       | Implement “hover effect” on site                                     | Dev/You   | Small, visible UI win → quick credibility bump.                      |

|       | Prep screenshot + micro-demo of site feature                         | You       | Asset for future post/sharing.                                       |
| Day 7 | Write retrospective (what worked, what didn’t)                       | You       | Capture lessons for Stage 7 planning.                               |

## Priorities
- **Big tasks**: Publish post, site features (hover + modal), engagement loop.
- **Small tasks**: DMs, replies, QA, retrospective.

## Risks
- Low post engagement → mitigate by active commenting + DM outreach.
- Site tasks slipping → cut scope (hover > modal > export).
- Overload risk → 2–3 big + 2–3 small enforced daily.

## Dependencies
- LinkedIn post slot (Tue AM optimal).
- PDF finalized before Day 1.
- Site dev time available for hover/modal features.
