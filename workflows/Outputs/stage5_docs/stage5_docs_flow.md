## Task
- Sheet-GPT updates documentation and ensures everything is consistent in GitHub.
- Update CHANGELOG with Stage 3 and Stage 4 milestones.

## Output

## Flow to Next Stages
1. Stage 6 – Catalyst-GPT → Builds 1-week execution roadmap (publish LinkedIn post, share PDF, apply site tasks).

## Notes
- Stage 5 ensures **traceability**: every stage’s outputs are logged and backed up.
- No new creative text – focus is documentation & consistency.
