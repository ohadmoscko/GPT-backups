## Demo Title
[Insert chosen demo idea]

---

## Goal
- What problem does this demo solve?
- Why is it compelling for the audience?
- What value (time/money saved) does it clearly show?

---

## Scenario (Real-Life Use Case)
- Short description of the real scenario.
- Example input (user task or question).

2. **Strategy Agent** → [Describe its role in this demo]
3. **Risk Auditor Agent** → [Describe its role in this demo]
4. **Documentation Agent** → [Describe its role in this demo]
5. **Catalyst Agent** → [Describe its role in this demo]

## Cost & Time Savings
- Manual process: [time & cost estimate]
- With agents: [time & cost estimate]
- Clear “savings” metric (hours, ILS, or both).

---

## Prototype Plan
- Minimal UI (cards, modal, or simple chat panel).
- Data sources (markdown outputs, JSON files).
- What is hardcoded vs what feels “live”.
- Any visuals (PDF, chart, screenshot).

---

## Next Steps
- What to build this week (thin-slice).
- What to leave for later (nice-to-have).
- Who will use/test this demo.
