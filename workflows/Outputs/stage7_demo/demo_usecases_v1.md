## Comparison Table

| Demo Idea | Value | Cost | Risk | Timeline | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------|------|----------|-------|
| Idea 1    |       |      |      |          |       |
| Idea 2    |       |      |      |          |       |

| Idea 4    |       |      |      |          |       |

## Criteria
- **Value** → Does it clearly show time/money savings? Is it exciting?  
- **Cost** → Can it be built quickly (<1 week, <1,000 ILS)?  
- **Risk** → Chance it overpromises, feels gimmicky, or hard to execute?  
- **Timeline** → Estimated time to deliver demo.  
- **Notes** → Why it’s compelling as a first demo.  

## Next Step
- Populate this table with use cases from Idea-GPT (fresh chat).
- Select one demo idea as **Stage 7.1 – First Demo Prototype**.
