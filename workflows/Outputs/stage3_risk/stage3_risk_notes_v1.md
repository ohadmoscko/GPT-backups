# Stage 3 – Risk Review Notes (v1)

## Scope
- Reviewed: stage1_pitch_v1.md (HE/EN), post_linkedin_v1.md, posts_summary_table_v1.md

## Findings
- ✅ Tone: authentic, non-hype.
- ✅ Claims: avoids guarantees; “pilot”, “rough edges” keep expectations realistic.
- ⚠️ Links: placeholders [PDF_LINK], [SITE_LINK] not ready — add only after assets exist.
- ⚠️ Length: within LinkedIn typical range; keep emojis at 0.
- ⚠️ Privacy/IP: do not expose private repo paths or internal JSON.

## Required Edits (applied in approved version)
- Moved links to “first comment when ready”.
- Kept EN→HE structure but tightened wording for clarity.

## Do-Not-Reveal-Yet Checklist
1. No direct links to private repos.
2. Don’t publish raw JSON or internal identifiers.
3. Don’t state total Q&A counts as “finished”.
4. Don’t promise API integrations until live.
5. Don’t share internal timelines/dates.
6. Don’t disclose toolchain secrets beyond high-level.
7. Don’t share emails/DM screenshots.
8. Keep demo phrasing as “first look”, not “full release”.
9. Avoid performance claims (e.g., “10x”).
10. Add links only after the PDF/site are ready.

## Status
- Approved Post: `post_linkedin_approved_v1.md`
- Ready to handoff to Stage 4 (Asset Pack).
