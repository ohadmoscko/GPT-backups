Background

Stage 1 (Idea): Drafted bilingual elevator pitches (Hebrew + English).

Stage 2 (Posts): Created first LinkedIn draft (bilingual, EN→HE).

Post v2 update:

Personal opening (“Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a small experiment for myself”).

Clear framing: manual pilot, not API-connected yet.

Everyday example of how the 7 agents collaborate.

Closing with a soft call-to-action (comments + professional questions).

Assets included: Screenshot + JSON workflow (visual proof, not just text).

Task

Perform a risk audit on the LinkedIn post (v2):

Check compliance with criteria:

Hook present.

Body: 3–5 lines (EN → HE), includes 7 agents, changelogs, docs, demo soon.

CTA: soft, open-ended.

≤3 hashtags.

Post length: 700–1,100 chars (LinkedIn target).

Authentic, professional tone, minimal emojis (0–2).

Placeholders kept ([PDF_LINK], [SITE_LINK]).

Framing risks:

How the “manual pilot” positioning is perceived (strength or weakness?).

Does stressing not API-connected protect from comparisons to market-ready tools?

Risk of looking “too personal/experimental” vs. useful for others.

Channel risks:

LinkedIn algorithm penalties (links, engagement triggers).

Hashtags: too generic vs. effective reach.

Format: question at the end, visual asset included.

Recommendations:

Minor language tweaks (clarity, brevity).

Stronger emphasis on reader’s benefit (efficiency/time-savings).

Technical posting advice (link in first comment, seed engagement, timing).

Constraints

Do not draft new posts.

Focus only on auditing and minor improvements.

Keep feedback professional, authentic, non-hype.
