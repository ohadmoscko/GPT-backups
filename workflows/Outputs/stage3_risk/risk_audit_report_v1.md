Compliance Checklist
Criterion	Status	Notes
Hook present	✅ Pass	Clear, personal opening.
Body 3–5 lines (EN→HE)	✅ Pass	Both EN & HE included, covers 7 agents, workflow, docs.
Includes 7 agents, changelogs, docs, demo soon	⚠️ Needs Fix	Mentions 7 agents + docs, but “demo soon” is not explicitly stated. Could be added.
CTA (soft, open-ended)	✅ Pass	Invites comments + questions.
≤3 hashtags	✅ Pass	Uses #AI #Productivity #Agents.
LinkedIn length 700–1,100 chars	⚠️ Needs Check	Likely within range, but should be verified in character count.
Authentic, professional tone	✅ Pass	Transparent, personal pilot framing.
Emojis ≤ 2	✅ Pass	None used.
Placeholders ([PDF_LINK], [SITE_LINK]) kept	✅ Pass	Included.
Red Flags Table
Risk	Impact	Likelihood	Recommendation
“Not API-connected” could be seen as weakness	Readers may dismiss project as “unfinished.”	Medium	Frame it as deliberate: “first step is manual validation, automation next.”
No explicit “demo soon” mention	Reduces anticipation/curiosity.	Medium	Add one line: “First demo examples coming soon.”
Too personal/experimental framing	May seem irrelevant to others’ workflows.	Medium	Add one line linking back to potential reader use-cases (efficiency, time-saving).
Links inside post may reduce reach	LinkedIn may penalize external links.	High	Keep [SITE_LINK] / [PDF_LINK] placeholders for now, but best to put actual link in first comment.
Suggested Improvements (Quick Wins)

Add “demo soon” line → to signal progress and continuity.

Shift benefit to reader → e.g., “Curious where a team like this could save you time” (already present in v1, can merge with v2 wording).

Clarify manual-first → automation-next as a strength, not a gap.

Plan link placement → if you add a live site later, put it in first comment.

✅ Exit Status:

Post is compliant with most criteria.

Only minor fixes needed (demo mention, explicit reader benefit line).

Safe to move forward once these tweaks are applied.
