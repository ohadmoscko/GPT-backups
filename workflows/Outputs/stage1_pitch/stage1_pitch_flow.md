# Stage 1 – Pitch: Output Flow

## Input
- Agent: **Idea-GPT**
- Task: Draft Elevator Pitch (HE + EN)

## Output
- File: `workflows/outputs/stage1_pitch/stage1_pitch_v1.md`
- Content: 2 pitch versions (Hebrew + English)

## Flow to Next Stages
1. **Stage 2 – Closer-GPT**  
   - Uses the Pitch as the **core input** to draft 3 posts (LinkedIn / Facebook / Forum).

2. **Stage 3 – Risk Auditor GPT**  
   - Reviews both the posts and the original Pitch.  
   - Identifies risky claims, vague language, credibility issues.  
   - Produces refined/approved versions.

3. **Stage 4 – Idea-GPT (again)**  
   - Takes the approved Pitch and adapts it into text for the **one-page PDF (Asset Pack)**.  
   - This creates a polished version, ready for public assets.

## Notes
- Stage 1 Pitch is **not final** → it’s a seed draft.  
- It becomes sharper and more reliable after Risk Review (Stage 3).  
- By Stage 4, the Pitch is repurposed into both posts & marketing assets.
