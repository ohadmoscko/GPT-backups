# AI Agents Workflow Project

This repo documents the private “DNA” of a system of 7 AI agents, each with its own role.  
Every stage of the workflow is backed up here with clear outputs and versioned documentation.

## Current Status (v1.0.3)
- Preparing for **first demo release**.
- Risk audit completed and outreach content approved.
- PDF draft and site tasks ready for integration.
- Next stage: **Execution Roadmap** (Stage 6).

## Structure
- `workflows/outputs/` → All outputs per stage (1–6).
- `templates/` → Agent briefs and reusable templates.
- `prompts/` → Instructions for each agent.
- `CHANGELOG.md` → Global changelog (cross-agent, project level).
